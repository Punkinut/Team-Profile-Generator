## Why make this?
This is designed for managers in any workforce who want to list out their team members and have it displayed on a webpage. This is a very simple application that makes it easier to generate a website!

## My goal
The goal was to generate a very clean user interface and error prone program so that any user understands how the application works.

## Running the tests
In the file directory you will need to install third party npm packages by opening it in your terminal and call npm init -y, npm install jest and npm install inquirer.

Right click any of the test and open it up in the terminal and type npm test.
